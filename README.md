# Platform-Demo
This project will be a game of type platformer, it will be done using godot engine, this is by no means a tutorial, this is just pure experimentation, now if you want to find great tutorials in godot look for GDquest.

Controls:

Use the arrows to move and jump, Z to change the signs and x to reset the sign, esc to load and when you find a disk press enter when you are over it to save.

For the first puzzle: press 5 times z on the first sign, 4 times z  on the second sign, 4 times z on the third sign and just press z on the fourth sign until the obstacle dissapears.

For the second puzzle: press z just one time per sign in this order: first sign, third sign, fourth sign, fifth sign and second sign.
